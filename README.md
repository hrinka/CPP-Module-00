  and some other basic stuff

## Introduction
This is the first project we've ever done in C++. For this reason, things will start slow. In this first set of exercises we will learn about the basic syntax of C++, namespaces, classes, member functions, and several other new concepts. All in all, it's lots of basic stuff.

## ex00. Megaphone
This first exercise is quite simple, we are asked to create a program that takes arguments and prints them back to the terminal in capital letters. If no arguments are provided the program will print out a default message, also in captial letters.

## ex01. My Awesome PhoneBook
This second exercise is a bit more fun. We have to simulate a phonebook with a terminal interactive UI. We can ADD or SEARCH for contacts, and we can also EXIT, clearing the list of contacts and ending the program. The phonebook can receive up to 8 contacts, such that the 9th contact will replace the 1st contact, the 10th will replace the 2nd, and so on.

## ex02. The Job Of Your Dreams
In this third and last exercise we are given two files which will help us build a class and all the necessary static and member functions so that the provided main function in tests.cpp creates the same output as the file 19920104_091532.log (save the different timestamps). Our job is to figure out what the functions do to create the appropriate file Account.cpp. We are also given the header file containing the class definition in Account.hpp.

## Installation
For this project and fututre C++ projects it is only required to have clang and/or gcc, which provide their respective compilers clang++ and g++. It is also recommended to install the valgrind package on Linux for debugging purposes. Every exercise (unless specified otherwise) includes its own Makefile with the necessary instructions. In some cases certain tweaks needed to be made to ensure the most similar results in both Linux and MacOS.
